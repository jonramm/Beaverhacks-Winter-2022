# Beers Near Me App (or whatever we want to call it)

So now we have the app set up as essentially two apps: a react front-end application and an express back-end REST api. 

To use the project on your local machine, you can clone the repository. Then, use these two commands in both the brewery-app and breweries-backend directories:

`npm install`

Once you've installed all the dependencies. You can run both applications in development mode by using the command in both directories:

`npm start`

The react application will run on localhost:8000 and the express api will run on localhost:3000.
